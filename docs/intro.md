# 🏗️ Homelab (Under Construction)

Welcome to my Homelab—a digital playground where enterprise tools meet curiosity.

This section is currently under construction as I document my journey building a self-hosted environment for experimentation, learning, and digital self-sufficiency. From Kubernetes clusters to secrets management, network design to monitoring stacks, this is where I test, break, and rebuild it all.

Check back soon for posts on:

- My current homelab architecture
- How I’m using GitOps, Kubernetes, and Terraform at home
- Ideas on minimal, portable, and off-grid computing
